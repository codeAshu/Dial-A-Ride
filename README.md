Dial-A-Ride
===========
Dial a ride is a cab sharing problem in which the system has to give the complete schedule of the
given cabs to maximize the total revenue.Cabs can share the passengers according to the capacity
given to the system. The input to the system are nodes of the city in form of matrix, location
of cabs at midnight,capacity of cabs and all the requests. The system has been developed for on line request processing 
so the total requests are already known to system and no dynamic request allowed. The output of the system will give 
the path of the cab as locations where it has served a request and time when for the same. 
A report on the implementation with all the data structure and methods used for developing the 
algorithm is attached with the source code.The programming
language used for developing the algorithm is Java.
